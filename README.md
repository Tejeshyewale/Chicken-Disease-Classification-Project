# 🐔 Chicken Disease Classification

An end-to-end **Deep Learning & MLOps project** that detects chicken diseases from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This project demonstrates data ingestion, model training, evaluation, experiment tracking, and deployment using Flask and Docker.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Poultry diseases can cause major losses for farmers. This project helps in automatically identifying whether a chicken is healthy or infected using image classification.

The project covers:

* Data Ingestion
* Data Validation
* Data Transformation
* Model Training
* Model Evaluation
* Model Deployment
* CI/CD Integration

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* OpenCV
* Flask
* DVC (Data Version Control)
* MLflow (optional for experiment tracking)
* Docker
* GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1️⃣ Data Ingestion

* Download dataset
* Store in artifacts folder
* Track using DVC

### 2️⃣ Data Validation

* Check data format
* Ensure no missing or corrupted files

### 3️⃣ Data Transformation

* Resize images
* Normalize pixel values
* Create train/test splits

### 4️⃣ Model Training

* Build CNN model
* Train on training dataset
* Save trained model

### 5️⃣ Model Evaluation

* Evaluate on test dataset
* Generate accuracy and loss metrics

### 6️⃣ Deployment

* Flask API for predictions
* Docker containerization
* CI/CD for automation

## 📊 Model Output

The model predicts:

* Healthy Chicken
* Diseased Chicken

Outputs prediction confidence score along with classification.

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Add more disease categories
* Improve accuracy with Transfer Learning
* Deploy on AWS / Azure
